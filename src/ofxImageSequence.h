 * ----------------------
 *
 *  ofxImageSequence is a class for easily loading a series of image files
 *  and accessing them like you would frames of a movie.
 *  
 *  This class loads only textures to the graphics card and does not store pixel data in memory. This helps with
 *  fast, random access drawing of seuqences
 *  
 *  Why would you use this instead of a movie file? A few reasons,
 *  If you want truly random frame access with no lag on large images, ofxImageSequence is a good way to go
 *  If you need a movie with alpha channel the only readily available codec is Animation (PNG) which is slow at large resolutions, so this class can help with that
 *  If you want to easily access frames based on percents this class makes that easy
 * 
 * //TODO: Extend ofBaseDraws
 * //TODO: experiment with storing pixels intead of textures and doing upload every frame
 * //TODO: integrate ofDirectory to API
